# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### What equipment do I need to start playing Air Hockey?
The basics include an Air Hockey table, mallets (also called strikers or paddles), and pucks. For casual play, any regulation-size table will do, but for competitive play, you'll want a professional-grade table.

### How do I choose my first Air Hockey table?
Consider factors like:
- Available space
- Budget
- Build quality
- Air flow system
- Electronic scoring
- Table surface material

## Techniques

### What's the basic stance for Air Hockey?
Stand slightly back from the table, knees bent, with your mallet held firmly but not too tight. This gives you good coverage and quick reaction time.

### How do I improve my defense?
- Stay centered
- Keep your mallet in front of your goal
- Watch the puck, not your opponent's mallet
- Practice blocking shots from different angles

## Rules & Gameplay

### What are the basic rules of Air Hockey?
- Only one puck in play at a time
- Players can only hit the puck when it's on their side
- No touching the puck with anything but the mallet
- First player to 7 points wins
- Points only count if the puck completely enters the goal

### What counts as a foul?
Common fouls include:
- Touching the puck with your hand
- "Topping" (placing the mallet on top of the puck)
- Crossing the centerline with your mallet
- Moving the table or causing distractions

## Maintenance

### How do I maintain my Air Hockey table?
- Clean the surface regularly
- Keep the air holes free of debris
- Check the fan system periodically
- Replace worn out mallets and pucks
- Keep the table covered when not in use

### How often should I clean my table?
For regular home use, clean the surface weekly and check the air holes monthly. Professional tables need more frequent maintenance.
